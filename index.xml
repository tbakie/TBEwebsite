      <description>To iteratively develop ü¶æa Hugo static website and see changes on the spot, you can use Hugo&amp;rsquo;s built-in local server which live reloads as you make changes to your site. Here&amp;rsquo;s a step-by-step guide:
Install Hugo on your local machine. Navigate to your Hugo site directory via the command line. Run hugo server in the command line. This command starts a local web server and auto-regenerates your site whenever you make changes to the content.</description>

      <description>In this assessment, I have built a TODO list manager. Productivity tools like TODO lists are becoming increasingly popular and with File I/O and ArrayLists you will be able to build one (and implement one or more features of your choosing!). My TODO list manager will allow a user to add items to a TODO list, mark TODOs as completed and save and load TODOs to and from a file.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator that is used to build websites quickly and efficiently. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo generates pages when you create or update your content. It converts your content into plain HTML files, providing reusable components and a convenient standard file structure‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.
A static website is one where the content is fixed and the same for every user, and is stored on the server as plain HTML files.</description>
