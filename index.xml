      <description>Hugo is a popular, open-source static site generator that is used to build websites quickly and efficiently. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo generates pages when you create or update your content. It converts your content into plain HTML files, providing reusable components and a convenient standard file structure‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.
A static website is one where the content is fixed and the same for every user, and is stored on the server as plain HTML files.</description>
