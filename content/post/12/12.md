## Transforming How We Interact with Technology
🚩When we are first born as human beings we know almost nothing, but as the days go by we learn new things and apply them in our lives to build some skills. The same is true for machines, machine learning collects data and statistics from outside and starts to perform given tasks without programming. For example, if you show a computer a picture of a watermelon and an apple and it is programmed to learn, the statistical models in the data will allow it to recognize a watermelon or an apple. The computer will be able to recognize that the watermelon is larger and greener in color and will be able to easily distinguish between watermelon and apple in the future.

**After we've covered the fundamentals, let's look at how machine learning actually works.** 
- 🚩Consider it similar to teaching a friend a new skill. First, you must provide them with several instances or experiences. This is referred to as **data collecting and preparation** in machine learning. You collect a variety of data and prepare it for the machine to learn from.
- 🚩Then you begin the real teaching, or **training the model** in machine learning terms. It's like machine learning working by evaluating itself, for example, the more we study for the exam, the better result we expect.
- 🚩After your machine has learned enough, you want to see how well it's doing. This is like a practice test before the real one. If the machine is not giving good results, it means that you need to improve or change your teaching method
- 🚩Finally, once your machine is fully trained and ready to go, you launch it into the outside world. This is referred to as **deployment**. The machine can now use what it's learned to accomplish all sorts of wonderful things.

## Applications of Machine Learning
After doing some research, I discovered some pretty cool applications of machine learning today. 
🚩The first one like having a super-smart helper for doctors in healthcare. It can anticipate diseases long before they become serious and aid in the development of medicines customized specifically to you. 
🚩The second one about  self-driving cars. These are the machine learning world's prodigies. They process a large amount of information from their environment and make split-second decisions when driving. It's the same as giving cars a brain.
🚩Now for the third and most essential one for me! Consider this the next time you go shopping online and receive those 'you might also like' suggestions. The brains behind such recommendations are machine learning algorithms, which ensure that we find exactly what we need **(and sometimes what we didn't even realize we needed🤐).**
