ðŸ“ŒIncorporating code snippets into your **Hugo website** can greatly enhance its functionality and appeal, especially if you're showcasing your programming projects. Markdown, a lightweight markup language, offers an easy way to format text and code for web pages. For example, in a Hugo site's showcase section, you can display Java code neatly formatted for readability. Here's how:
- ðŸ“ŒOpen Your Markdown File: Navigate to the Markdown file where you want to include your code snippet in your Hugo site's content folder.
- ðŸ“ŒInsert the Code Block: To display a Java code snippet, wrap your code in triple backticks (```) followed by the language identifier. For Java, it would look like this
 ```java
(```) // Without parentheses
// Your Java code here
(```) // Without parentheses
```

- ðŸ“ŒAdd Your Java Code: Inside the backticks, paste your Java code. For instance:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class TodoListManager {
    // Your Java code continues...
}
```
- ðŸ“ŒSave and Preview: Save the Markdown file and use Hugo's server to preview your website. The Java code should appear properly formatted in the showcase section.

**Remember**, correctly marking down your code not only makes it more readable but also enhances the overall user experience on your website.
