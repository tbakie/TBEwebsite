# My Journey with Meteor Detection at SEAL Lab
Have you ever stopped to think about how much space debris is falling to Earth every single day? Well, NASA estimates that 48.5 tons of meteoritic material hits our planet daily! When I first read that, I was mind-blown. This sparked my interest in studying meteor showers more closely—and what better way to do that than by diving into the world of signal processing, antennas, and space science?

During my time as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at SEAL Lab, I got to work on an exciting project aimed at detecting meteors using passive antennas to capture Very-Low-Frequency (VLF) and Ultra-Low-Frequency (ULF) signals. Essentially, we’re capturing the electromagnetic signals from meteors as they burn up in Earth’s atmosphere—pretty cool, right?

We started by deploying our system during the Geminid meteor shower in December 2023, and while we had some success, there was a LOT to improve. Fieldwork can be a humbling experience when things don’t go exactly as planned. That said, the Perseid meteor shower in August 2024 gave us another chance to test out our upgrades and refine our approach.

## Looking Forward
We’ve come a long way since our first field test, but there’s always room for improvement. Moving forward, I’m excited to continue refining the software to make data processing faster and more accurate. We’re also looking at boosting storage capacity even further and possibly adding more sensors to the system to give us an even clearer picture of what’s going on in the sky.

This experience has taught me so much—not just about technical stuff like antennas and signal processing, but about problem-solving in the field, working as a team, and adapting to challenges as they come up. I’m really proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, and I can’t wait to see where this research goes next.
