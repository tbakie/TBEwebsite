## To iteratively develop
 a Hugo static website and see changes on the spot, you can use Hugo's built-in local server which live reloads as you make changes to your site. Here's a step-by-step guide:

- Install Hugo on your local machine.
- Navigate to your Hugo site directory via the command line.
- Run hugo server in the command line.
- This command starts a local web server and auto-regenerates your site whenever you make changes to the content.
- You can now see your changes in real-time by viewing http://localhost:1313 in your web browser.
As you iterate on your website, you simply edit the files, and the changes will be reflected immediately in your browser, enabling a smooth and rapid development cycle.
