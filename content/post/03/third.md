## ‚ù§Ô∏èGitHub
 is a widely-used platform for hosting, storing, and editing code. It is particularly popular for managing source code, offering robust version control and collaboration features. Individuals and organizations use GitHub to host small websites, organize projects, and collaborate with teammates and community members. GitHub's core elements are "Repositories," which are used to organize code for single projects. The platform supports both private and public repositories, allowing for internal collaboration within organizations as well as open-source project development. GitHub also offers GitHub Pages, a feature that enables users to host websites directly from their GitHub repositories

 üëâHosting a website using GitHub Pages is a straightforward process that involves creating a GitHub account, setting up a new repository with specific rules, and then editing and uploading your code to make your website live. GitHub Pages is particularly suited for hosting static websites‚Äã
