My name is Tugrul Baki Efesoy, a sophomore at the University of Washington pursuing dual majors in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. In addition to my academic endeavors, I serve as the president of the Turkish Club, which boasts a vibrant community of over 50 active members. We focus on cultural events and educational initiatives to create an inclusive environment. Beyond academics and leadership, my hobbies like basketball and hiking provide a balanced lifestyle. Looking ahead, I aim to integrate my academic skills and leadership experiences to make meaningful contributions in technology and community building
