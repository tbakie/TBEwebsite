 I will post the interview questions I did here on **leetcode** and share important information about them here, such as important points I found important, parts I had difficulty with and new things I learned.

## Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
ðŸ‘‡
- The important thing for me is **j = i + 1** and **nums.length - 1** therefore i and j will be never equal
```java
 class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{}; // No solution found
    }
}
```

## Question 1480
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i])
Return the running sum of nums.
ðŸ‘‡ 
- This is a basic beginner question, but one line is important for me, which is **nums[i] += nums[i - 1]** instead of **nums[i] += nums[i + 1]**   
```java
class Solution {
public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Result at index `i` is sum of result at `i-1` and element at `i`.
            nums[i] += nums[i - 1];
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
