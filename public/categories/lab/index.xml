      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever stopped to think about how much space debris is falling to Earth every single day? Well, &lt;strong&gt;NASA&lt;/strong&gt; estimates that 48.5 tons of meteoritic material hits our planet daily! When I first read that, I was mind-blown. This sparked my interest in studying meteor showers more closely—and what better way to do that than by diving into the world of signal processing, antennas, and space science?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my time as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at SEAL Lab, I got to work on an exciting project aimed at detecting meteors using passive antennas to capture Very-Low-Frequency (VLF) and Ultra-Low-Frequency (ULF) signals. Essentially, we’re capturing the electromagnetic signals from meteors as they burn up in Earth’s atmosphere—pretty cool, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
